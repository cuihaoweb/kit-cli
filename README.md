# What is create-kit-cli?
create-kit-cli is a cli for creating project templates

# Why not use existing scaffolding?
Some mature scaffolders, such as create-react-app and create-vue-app, over-encapsulate the project, resulting in more detailed configuration

create-kit-cli is a custom configuration based on mature packaging compilers such as webpack and vite, and developers can also perform more fine-grained configuration on this basic configuration

# How to use
1. Installation
```bash
npm install create-kit-cli -g
```

2. Create a project
```bash
kit-cli create appName
```
